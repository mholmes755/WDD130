    <p>
        I am a Software Engineer Major attending BYUI online. I was born in North Carolina and that's where I grew up.
        When I was 12 however, my family moved to Virginia because my dad got a new job.
        I went on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in 2020 and recently returned last July. 
        I moved to Rexburg, Idaho in January and I work as a Professional Sleep Consultant at a mattress outlet store.
        I met my fiance on my mission on an island called Guam in the western Pacific ocean.
        Last month we got engaged and are getting sealed in the Meridian, Idaho LDS temple this August!
