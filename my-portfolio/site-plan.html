        <strong>Site Summary</strong><br>
        The purpose of this website will be to showcase select programs that I have created in order to demonstrate
        my proficiency in coding. Each page in the website will showcase a different language that I have learned,
        or am learning. The only slight exception to this rule will be in regards to the following languages:
        html, css, and java script. As all of these languages can be connected together to create websites, they will
        be displayed together unless there is a style or script that is not related to an html file. In which case these
        files will be displayed separately within their own page designated for that language. As I learn more languages
        that connect to another, they will follow the same pattern for where they are displayed. This website will be an
        expanding container for all such programs because I will continue to add to, and grow my portfolio. I want to keep
        a detailed collection of all that I have accomplished to show employers so that I might gain future employment.
        The site will eventually contain multiple pages to showcase highlighted programs. At the bottom of each page there
        will also be a link to all other projects that I have accomplished if an employer would want to see more of my work.
        
      </p>
      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        This paragraph will tell my audience a little about myself and how I got interested in coding as well as how I came to
        be the developer/programmer that I am. It will describe my life through the perspective of the industry. How each exposure
        to the field helped me learn more about it and gain skills and knowledge. It will also detail events in my life that lead 
        me to those exposures such as moving, taking a particular class and so on and so forth. The purpose of this paragraph will
        be to show potenetial employers how serious I am about this field and career path because of the amount of time, effort,
        and money that I have invested into this career path and field of study. This paragraph will answer the questions:
        "Who am I?", "How did I start coding?", "Why do I continue to code?", and "What I hope to accomplish with coding?".

      <h3>Python Programs</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Page Summary</strong><br>
        The purpose of this page will be to store the various python programs that I have ever written. Whether for school or for
        work. I will also provide brief descriptions of what each program does and why I created it. The importance of programs is
        not only their function, but also the principles that are used in them. If you do not learn from the programs you create
        then there is almost no reason for their creation. That is why I wish to show the purpose for their creation to demonstrate
        that I can apply different principles within different languages to a wide variety of projects. That I think is the best 
        demonstration of ones ability.

      <h3>HTML/CSS Programs</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Page Summary</strong>
        <br>
        The purpose of this page will be the same purpose as the "Python Programs" page. The only difference is the languages that will be displayed.
        I will still continue to display the programs that I created, but for the language html and css, I will still explain the reason they were created,
        whether for work or for school, or any other reason. Because this page will be showcasing both HTML as well as CSS, I will be displaying
        them side by side with similar break downs.
