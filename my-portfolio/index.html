                <p>The purpose of this website will be to showcase select programs that I have created in order to demonstrate
                    my proficiency in coding. Each page in the website will showcase a different language that I have learned,
                    or am learning. The only slight exception to this rule will be in regards to the following languages:
                    html, css, and java script. As all of these languages can be connected together to create websites, they will
                    be displayed together unless there is a style or script that is not related to an html file. In which case these
                    files will be displayed separately within their own page designated for that language. As I learn more languages
                    that connect to another, they will follow the same pattern for where they are displayed. This website will be an
                    expanding container for all such programs because I will continue to add to, and grow my portfolio. I want to keep
                    a detailed collection of all that I have accomplished to show employers so that I might gain future employment.
                    The site will eventually contain multiple pages to showcase highlighted programs. At the bottom of each page there
                    will also be a link to all other projects that I have accomplished if an employer would want to see more of my work.

                    My name is Michael Holmes. I grew up in North Carolina and moved to Virginia when I was in middle school/junior high. 
                It was there that I had my first exposure to the programming world. I had taken a class where we built little robots and used
                a program to write a very basic code that we would upload to the robots. As I began high school, I took more classes that
                involved computers in a more general sense. Less programming, but still keeping myself involved. In the later years I was able
                to take engineering and technology classes that delved deeper into coding languages and logic. These languages included binary,
                html/css, C++, and python. It was here that I really got to understand programming a litte more and find that I enjoyed it. 
                After graduating I went to work in construction and forgot about code and how much I enjoyed it. Soon I began a religious mission
                trip for my church. I was removed from most forms of technology for 2 years as I labored to teach others about Jesus Christ and 
                His restored Gospel. Upon returning from my mission, I enrolled in a brief free course in html to see if I still enjoyed working with 
                code, and to my excitment I still did. Because I enjoyed it so much I wanted to learn more and so I decided to base my career and 
                education around studying code. I have devoted lots of extra time learning on my own so that I might be able to learn more and make 
                the programs I create more efficient and astetically pleasing to viewers. I really want to have my programs make a difference. Whether
                that means making a company's website run a little smoother, solving problems with algorithms in crypto currencies, searching through
                data bases, securing websites and information, or anything else. I want to be able to help fill the needs that people have.
