                This is going to be something cool to type
                for an article that is relevant and cool.
                If I keep typing will it keep getting bigger?
                I think that I just need to keep typing text
                and my white space will kepe growing so that my 
                page will look the way it's supposed to. Anyways,
                typing is kind of fun. I'm just going to type about my
                day today so far. Anna came and woke me up around 8 as 
                she was getting ready for work. We made breakfast then I 
                scrolled memes for a while on insta which wasn't good at all.
                Then I checked on the wedding band that I ordered, and it is 
                taking WAY longer than it should be! I was told 2 weeks and 
                it's been almost 3! Way behind. They're going to send it to 
                my address for free now because of the inconvenience which
                I appreciate. I was told I'd have it by now! A little upset
                but what else can I do? So I came home and now I'm doing hw
                and in a little while I'm going to start on dinner for Anna. 
                Fried chicken with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes!
