            <div id="main-page-summary">
                <p>The purpose of this website will be to showcase select programs that I have created in order to demonstrate
                    my proficiency in coding. Each page in the website will showcase a different language that I have learned,
                    or am learning. The only slight exception to this rule will be in regards to the following languages:
                    html, css, and java script. As all of these languages can be connected together to create websites, they will
                    be displayed together unless there is a style or script that is not related to an html file. In which case these
                    files will be displayed separately within their own page designated for that language. As I learn more languages
                    that connect to another, they will follow the same pattern for where they are displayed. This website will be an
                    expanding container for all such programs because I will continue to add to, and grow my portfolio. I want to keep
                    a detailed collection of all that I have accomplished to show employers so that I might gain future employment.
                    The site will eventually contain multiple pages to showcase highlighted programs. At the bottom of each page there
                    will also be a link to all other projects that I have accomplished if an employer would want to see more of my work.

            <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
            <div id="about-me-text">
                <p>This paragraph will tell my audience a little about myself and how I got interested in coding as well as how I came to
                be the developer/programmer that I am. It will describe my life through the perspective of the industry. How each exposure
                to the field helped me learn more about it and gain skills and knowledge. It will also detail events in my life that lead 
                me to those exposures such as moving, taking a particular class and so on and so forth. The purpose of this paragraph will
                be to show potenetial employers how serious I am about this field and career path because of the amount of time, effort,
                and money that I have invested into this career path and field of study. This paragraph will answer the questions:
                "Who am I?", "How did I start coding?", "Why do I continue to code?", and "What I hope to accomplish with coding?"
